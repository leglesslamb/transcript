# Transcript

A transcriber for European scripts. This isn't meant to be a translator, but rather character-wise transcription.

## Transcription Rules

There is some augmentation in some rules to cover more script characters.

- Latin to Braille (unimplemented)
- Latin to Cyrillic (unimplemented)
- Latin to Greek (unimplemented)
- Latin to Runic (Elder Futhark)

  ```sh
  transcript -lref "This is in Elder Futhark."
  ᚦᛁᛊ ᛁᛊ ᛁᚾ ᛖᛚᛞᛖᚱ ᚠᚢᚦᚨᚱᚲ.
  ```

If there are any errors (especially with transcribing), please open an issue.
